1. Scope is where variables are available in your program. The two options are global scope and local scope. Global scope
is when the variable is available everywhere within your program whereas local scope is restricted to a particular portion of your code. 

2. Global variables are avoided because you want to make sure that variables aren't changed unintentionally by different portions of your program.
Also, global variables are to be avoided in order to avoid conflicts. 

3. JavaScript's strict mode forces variables to be declared and thus prevents the accidental creation of global variables.

4. Side effects is when your function creates or changes a variable outside of the function. Pure functions have 2 requirements.
The first requirement is that there is no side effects and the second is that it is determinant (given the same input only one determinant output is possible).
